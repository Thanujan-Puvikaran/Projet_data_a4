##### - The command that you must use if you want to run the API:
    1. For any machine:
        - pip install -r requirements.txt
        - cd main
        - python main.py
        
    2. For windows machine 
        - The easier way is to run the batch.bat file (on windows only)
        using:
            - with bash environment: bash batch.sh
            - with anaconda environment(cmd): batch.bat
